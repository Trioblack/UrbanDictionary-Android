Urban Dictionary
============

A simple Android client for Urban Dictionary

Things you should be aware of
=============================

A weekend project, at first it was to test the new CardView and RecyclerView but it seems that they need the support-v4:21 which is only available for the AndroidL preview and I really wanted to post this app. You can still find some code related to RecyclerView but those files are not used.
As always this project is completely opensource, free and doesn't generate any profit. See below for the license.

***

This app use the following libs:

* android-support-v4
* retrofit
* rxjava-android
* crashlytics

***

This app is available on Google Play for free [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.florianmski.UrbanDictionary)

Futur
======

As this is "just" a weekend project, I don't plan to do any modifications on this app.
